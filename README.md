**Project Description:**

The project discussed involves the creation of an AirBnB clone, a simplified version of the popular accommodation rental platform. The clone includes a command-line interface (CLI) that allows users to interact with the system, perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on various objects like Users, Places, Cities, States, Amenities, and Reviews. The project also includes a storage system for managing object persistence.

**Command Interpreter Description:**

The command interpreter serves as the primary interface for interacting with the AirBnB clone system. It provides a set of commands that users can use to perform various operations.

**How to Start the Command Interpreter:**

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
4. Run the command interpreter script using the following command:
   ```
   python3 console.py
   ```

**How to Use the Command Interpreter:**

Once the command interpreter is started, you can use the following commands:

- **create**: Creates a new instance of a specified class.
  ```
  create <class_name>
  ```

- **show**: Displays details of a specific instance based on its class name and id.
  ```
  show <class_name> <id>
  ```

- **destroy**: Deletes a specific instance based on its class name and id.
  ```
  destroy <class_name> <id>
  ```

- **update**: Updates attributes of a specific instance based on its class name, id, and key-value pairs of attributes.
  ```
  update <class_name> <id> <attribute_name> "<attribute_value>"
  ```

- **all**: Displays details of all instances of a specified class.
  ```
  all <class_name>
  ```

- **quit**: Exits the command interpreter.
  ```
  quit
  ```

**Examples:**

1. Create a new User instance:
   ```
   (hbnb) create User
   ```

2. Show details of a specific User instance:
   ```
   (hbnb) show User 123456
   ```

3. Destroy a specific User instance:
   ```
   (hbnb) destroy User 123456
   ```

4. Update attributes of a specific User instance:
   ```
   (hbnb) update User 123456 email "new_email@example.com"
   ```

5. Display details of all User instances:
   ```
   (hbnb) all User
   ```

6. Exit the command interpreter:
   ```
   (hbnb) quit
   ```

These are just a few examples of how to use the command interpreter. You can explore more commands and functionalities based on your requirements.
